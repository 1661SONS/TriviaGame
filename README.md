# Black Panther Party Themed Trivia Game

### Unit 5 Homework Assignment

* When "Start Trivia" is clicked, a 30-second timer will begin counting down, one question will display and 4 multiple choice potential answers will also display. There are a total of 26 questions in the game.

* If the user selects the correct answer, they will be alerted "Correct!" via a pop-up and a nice blue "Correct!" banner. After dimissing the alert pop-up, another round will begin with the next question and a new 30-second timer counting down.

* If the user selects the wrong answer, they will be alerted "Incorrect!" via pop-up and a not-so-nice white banner with red text.

* Once the user has gone through all of the questions, their score will display: # of right answers and # of wrong answers.
